#### #Note: The app is still under development, many features are still to be developed so the images that you are viewing are till this point and will get updated as the app progresses.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Demo run:-

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75017563/150692270-633d5ad8-1691-45de-9469-0b85fd3f6712.mp4

From the app's name it get's clear that it is being developed for the purpose of making different new recipes from all over the world whether it's an Indian cuisine, USA cuisine ,Mexican cuisine or Italian cuisine. The app fetches more than 3000 recipes in it. The main structure of the app is like an recipe book diary which helps the user to make some good recipes of dishes they always wanted to taste and since it will be in the form of digital records the users will enjoy the tracking of the recipes in an optimized manner and also in a clean manner. Usually the person who cooks have tendency to write everthing in traditional pen-paper system which later becomes tedious for them to track or sometimes it may get slipped through their mind and in the end they loose the track and the chaos starts in the recipes . So to prevent this chaos the app is being deveoped.

Of course,my app does not have everything and since your needs may be different or I may have missed some corner cases or features . So I'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people who have inspired me for working towards this app :) !!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements ;).

### Built With

This app was build with the help of Kotlin for coding the brain of the app and for ui part the app used the new ui declarative way approach known as Jetpack compose ui.
So the beautification comes throughout the app because of the jetpack compose way. The XML are also used were there is a need. The hilt is used for dependency injection .

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The App is being created while keeping in mind that a user from any part of the world can access the app as the dish variety is humongous in nature. Since the nature of the app is of international scope

The main structure of the app is like an recipe book diary which helps the user to make some good recipes of dishes they always wanted to taste and since it will be in the form of digital records the users will enjoy the tracking of the recipes in an optimized manner and also in a clean manner. Usually the person who cooks have tendency to write everthing in traditional pen-paper system which later becomes tedious for them to track or sometimes it may get slipped through their mind and in the end they loose the track and the chaos starts in the recipes . So to prevent this chaos the app is being deveoped.

<!-- Design Workflow -->

## Design Workflow

The App is being created while keeping in mind that a user from any part of the world can access the app as the dish variety is humongous in nature.
